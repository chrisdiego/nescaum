        <Paragraph>
        Through a memorandum of understanding, 16 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian province of Quebec are working collaboratively to advance and accelerate the market for electric medium- and heavy-duty (MHD) vehicles, including large pickup trucks and vans, delivery trucks, box trucks, school and transit buses, and long-haul delivery trucks. The goal is to ensure that 100 percent of all new truck and bus sales are zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2050, with an interim target of at least 30 percent by 2030.

        To provide a framework for meeting these goals, the signatory jurisdictions are working through the Multi-State ZEV Task Force facilitated by NESCAUM to develop a MHD ZEV Action Plan. This page provides information about the process for developing the Action Plan and includes the following:
