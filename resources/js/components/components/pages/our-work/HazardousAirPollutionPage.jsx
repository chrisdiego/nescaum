        <Paragraph>
          The Clean Air Act requires EPA to regulate two categories of air pollutants. EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants, which are known as <b>criteria pollutants.</b> Those pollutants are ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead.   
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          EPA also has identified 187 <b>hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)</b> which are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects. EPA regulates HAPs with technology-based rules which are called National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs). Although EPA has not set air quality standards for HAPs, many states have developed health-based standards and guidelines for evaluating air quality impacts of the federal HAPs and other toxic air pollutants.
