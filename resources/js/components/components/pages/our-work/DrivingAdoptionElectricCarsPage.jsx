          Accelerating the transition to zero-emission passenger vehicles is critically important for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling the global climate crisis. Further, wide-scale adoption of electric cars is needed to reduce tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants that cause air quality and public health problems in many communities across the United States.

            In 2013, NESCAUM spearheaded the launch of a coalition of states committed to coordinating state policies and programs to propel growth in the market for electric cars and support their zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) regulatory programs (LINK TO REGULATIONS PAGE).  A governorâ€™s Memorandum of Understanding (LINK TO PDF) officially launched the Multi-State ZEV Task Force. NESCAUM facilitates and guides the Task Force, which serves as a unique forum for galvanizing state leadership on transportation electrification.
